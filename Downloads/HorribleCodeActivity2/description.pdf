For our submission, we made a basic calulator with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division functions - all of which are used inside the actual calculator function.
For our good code version:
We implemented the KISS principle and kept our code as simple as possible.
We implemented the DRY code principle by ensuring our code doesn't repeat parts unneccesarily.
We documented our code using short descriptions of each function, while avoiding too detailed of an explanation when the viewer should be able to tell what's happening.
We kept our code as clean as possible.

For the bad code version:
We overcomplicated some parts of the code, where we didn't need to, violating the KISS principle.
We repeated some variables in places they wouldn't necessarily need to be, including using an input variable when we were getting a user's input.
We documented our code in ways that were unneccessary and crude.
we did not keep our code very clean in this version.
